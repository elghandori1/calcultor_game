# Game Name: "Math Multiplication Game"

"Math Multiplication Game" is an educational game that aims to improve players' mathematical skills. The game presents a random multiplication operation to the player, and they must enter the correct answer. If the player enters the correct answer, they earn a point and a new operation is presented. If the answer is incorrect, it deducts from their remaining attempts, which are limited to three.

The game aims to motivate players to enhance their mathematical abilities and develop quick and accurate calculation skills. As the player achieves more correct answers, their points increase, and they progress in the game.

At the end of each round, the player's level in the game is displayed based on the number of points they have earned
