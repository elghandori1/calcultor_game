# Game Name: "Calculator Game"

This game is designed to help young children sharpen their mental arithmetic skills in a fun and engaging way.

### How it works
- Choose Your Operation: At the start of the game, you can choose the type of arithmetic operation you want to practice - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or a mix of them all.
- Answer the Questions: The game will present you with a series of arithmetic problems, like 2*4 or 3+3. Your task is to enter the correct answer.
- Be careful : You only have three chances. If you give the wrong answer three times, the game ends..
- Beat the Clock : Each problem must be solved in less than 30 seconds. As you progress, the difficulty increases and the time you have to solve each problem decreases.
